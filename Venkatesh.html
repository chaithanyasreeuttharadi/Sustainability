      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Blood pressure is the force that moves blood through our circulatory system.
        If you have normal blood pressure, your blood pressure is less than 120/80. Stick with an active lifestyle and healthy diet to keep that going.
        Treatments include lifestyle changes, and if that’s not enough, may also include medications.
        A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute.
        Although there's a wide range of normal, an unusually high or low heart rate may indicate an underlying problemGlucose is key to keeping the mechanisms of the body in top working order. When our glucose levels are optimal, it often goes unnoticed. But when they stray from recommended boundaries, you’ll notice the unhealthy effect it has on normal functioning.
        If you’re living with high levels of stress, you’re putting your entire well-being at risk. Stress wreaks havoc on your emotional equilibrium, as well as your physical health.
